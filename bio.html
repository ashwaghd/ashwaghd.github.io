                    <p>Alex Callister is a handyman with years of experience 
                        in the field of construction. Before serving a two year 
                        mission in Santiago Chile, he worked for various construction
                        companies gaining experience and learning the trade.</p>
                        
                        <p>His technique and attention to detail is second to none, and
                        his speed and efficiency are on a level of their own! When 
                        leaving his last job, his boss was sad to see him go because
                        of his quality of work.</p>

                        <p>Alex grew up curious by nature, with an apparent talent with his 
                        hands. He has always loved learning new skills, and years of 
                        experience has built a repertoire of abilities!
                    </p>
                    <p>Alex's Family is originally from Arizona, but moved to Saint George
                        while he was in 3rd grade. He is the second oldest of six children; 
                        a brother with his own business, and four little sisters that he adores. 
                        Each have their own creative passions as well!
